AI agents can act as autonomous workers to solve complex problems. Now, you get to build a team of them.

#### The Scenario: A Digital Banking Revolution

Imagine you work for a large international bank. Every single day, thousands of financial messages called **SWIFT messages** fly between your bank and others around the globe. These messages are the backbone of international money transfers, containing instructions to move millions of dollars. The challenge is that this process needs to be fast, accurate, and secure. Every message with an error has to be manually corrected by a human, which costs the bank time and money. Even worse, some of these transactions might be fraudulent. How can a bank possibly keep up?

This is where your AI system comes in.

#### Your Mission: Build an Agentic SWIFT Processing System

What is SWIFT? Think of it as the messaging system for the global banking world. When banks send money to each other across borders, they send a SWIFT message. It’s a secure, standardized way to communicate financial transactions. As you can guess, making sure these transactions are legitimate is a top priority for any bank.

In this project, you will build a multi-agent system to automate the processing of a batch of SWIFT transactions. Your system will be responsible for:

1. **Validating and Correcting** incoming messages to make sure they meet SWIFT standards.
2. **Detecting Potential Fraud** by analyzing transaction patterns.
3. **Processing Clean Transactions** efficiently.

You won't be building just one AI; you'll be implementing a pipeline of specialized agents that work together, each based on a specific agentic workflow design pattern.

**Meet Your Team of Agents:**

* **The Evaluator-Optimizer Agent:** Think of this as your  **Quality Control Specialist** . Its job is to inspect every incoming SWIFT message, identify any errors, and intelligently correct them.
* **The Parallelization Agent:** This is your  **Dispatcher** . To work faster, it will take the batch of validated messages and distribute them among multiple workers for simultaneous fraud screening.
* **The Prompt Chaining Agent:** This is the  **Lead Fraud Investigator** . For transactions that look suspicious, this agent performs a deeper, multi-step analysis to gather more evidence before making a final judgment.
* **The Orchestrator-Worker Agent:** This is the  **Operations Manager** . It takes the clean, verified transactions and delegates the final processing tasks to worker agents.

Banks measure their efficiency using a metric called the Straight-Through Processing (STP) rate—the percentage of transactions processed with zero manual intervention. A high STP rate saves millions of dollars. By building this system, you'll learn how AI agents can directly impact a financial institution's bottom line by improving efficiency and reducing risk.

You're about to build a practical, real-world application of agentic AI that showcases skills in workflows, system design, fraud analytics, and large language model implementation.
